# Joe's personal profile — nix-darwin + home-manager (P4, HOL-508)

# Layer ownership (from HOL-499 ADR):
#   - THIS FILE owns: tool versions (Nix-managed), macOS system settings
#   - chezmoi owns: shell configs (.zshrc), secret injection
#   - Doppler owns: all secrets
#
# home.file workspace dirs mirror docs/conventions/workspace-directory-layout.md.
# The run_once_after_create-workspace-dirs.sh.tmpl creates the same dirs via
# chezmoi; both are idempotent. Long-term (P5+) the script will be removed in
# favour of this declarative source of truth.

# `primaryUser` is supplied per-host via the flake's specialArgs, so this profile

# broke activation on any host with a different account name (dotfiles#117).
